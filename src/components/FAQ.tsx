  {
    q: "How quickly can I expect results?",
    a: "Most clients start seeing engagement within the first 2 weeks. Qualified calls typically start coming in within 30-60 days, depending on your niche and offer.",
  },
  {
    q: "What makes you different from other LinkedIn agencies?",
    a: "We combine founder-led content, outbound outreach, and low-cost LinkedIn ads into one unified system. Most agencies only do one of these — we do all three, and they compound together.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will this work in my niche?",
    a: "If your ideal client is on LinkedIn (B2B founders, executives, decision-makers), yes. We have proven results across SaaS, agencies, consulting, coaching, and more.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be a celebrity or influencer?",
    a: "Not at all. Our system is built for founders and operators, not influencers. You just need expertise and a willingness to share it authentically.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in the service?",
    a: "Content strategy, copywriting, design, scheduling, DM management, appointment setting, LinkedIn ads, outreach campaigns, and monthly reporting — all included.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you manage my DMs?",
    a: "We use a shared system where our team manages initial conversations, qualifies leads based on your criteria, and books calls directly onto your calendar.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you manage LinkedIn ad campaigns?",
    a: "Yes. We create, manage, and optimize LinkedIn ad campaigns designed to boost your highest-performing organic content to your ideal prospects.",
  },
  {
    q: "What type of content will you create?",
    a: "Text posts, carousels, infographics, short-form video scripts, and lead magnets — all crafted in your authentic voice from founder interviews.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the lead magnet strategy work?",
    a: "We create high-value free resources (guides, templates, frameworks) that drive inbound connections and newsletter signups from your ideal clients.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you ensure lead quality?",
    a: "Through precise targeting, custom qualification criteria, and a multi-touch nurture process. We only book calls with prospects who match your ideal client profile.",
